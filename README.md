How To:</br></br><pre>
      run the program? - Open the greastomatic.exe to change the Wallpaper.</br>
      use a different image?  - Replace the image named com_wallpaper.jpg with another image and name it as com_wallpaper.jpg.</br>
      change the exe name? - Rename the exe or create a shortcut in the desktop and rename it.</br></br></pre>

Notes:  </br></br><pre>
      The image should not have a different name and should be in the same folder of the exe to work. </br>
      Removing the dll in the files may cause the program to misbehave as Python code was converted to make this EXE .</br>
      Dont name the EXE with the pre existing/running EXE names (like explorer.exe, Brave.exe, crome.exe SysInfoCap.exe etc....)</br></br></pre>



TIPS:</br></br><pre>
     Hide the folder in a random location in the PC and create a shortcut of the exe, then rename and change its icon :)</br></br></pre>
